1) npm init
Purpose: Starts the process of creating a package.json file for your Node.js project.
What happens:

The answers are saved in package.json, which keeps track of your project’s dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

2) npm init -y
Purpose: Creates a default package.json instantly without asking questions.
What happens:
It uses default values for all fields.
Saves you time when you just want a quick start.


3) npm i bcrypt
Purpose: Installs the bcrypt library from npm.
What bcrypt does:
A hashing library used to securely store passwords (instead of saving plain text).
It adds random “salt” to make hashes harder to crack.
