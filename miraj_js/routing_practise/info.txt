First, we create separate route files for each specific module (e.g., user.routes.js and product.routes.js) inside the modules folder.

Next, we import and connect both user.routes.js and product.routes.js to a central file located in routes/index.js.

Finally, we connect routes/index.js (which acts as the main router) to the main index.js file at the project root, which serves as the application’s entry point.
